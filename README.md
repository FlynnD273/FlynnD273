My name is Flynn Duniho (they/them) and I really like programming. I mostly program in C# and Windows Presentation Foundation, but recently I've been learning more C and Python too. I'm a rising junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and I'm currently looking for summer software engineering internships.
