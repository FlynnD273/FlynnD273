### Hi there!

My name is Flynn Duniho and I really like programming. I mostly program in C# and Windows Presentation Foundation, but recently I've been learning more C and Python too. I'm of the class of 2025 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and I'm currently looking for full-time software engineering positions.
