### Hi there!

<!--
**FlynnD273/FlynnD273** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Flynn Duniho (they/them) and I really like programming. I mostly program in C# and Windows Presentation Foundation, but recently I've been learning more C and Python too. I'm a rising junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and I'm currently looking for summer software engineering internships.
